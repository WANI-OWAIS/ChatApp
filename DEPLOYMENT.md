# ChatterSphere Deployment Guide

## âœ… FIXED: GitHub Actions Workflow Updated

The deployment error has been fixed! The workflow now includes the required environment configuration.

## ðŸš€ What to do now:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Repository Settings (IMPORTANT!)
1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/WANI-OWAIS/ChatApp
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT Deploy from a branch)
4. Save the settings

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. Visit: https://wani-owais.github.io/ChatApp

## ðŸ”§ What was fixed:
- Added `environment: github-pages` to the workflow
- Moved permissions to the correct location
- Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggers
- Fixed job structure

## If still not working:

### Option 1: Check GitHub Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/WANI-OWAIS/ChatApp
2. Click Settings â†’ Pages
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Wait for the workflow to run

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Check
1. Check if the gh-pages branch exists
2. Verify files are in the gh-pages branch
3. Check GitHub Pages settings point to gh-pages branch

### Option 3: Alternative Base Configuration
If still not working, try changing vite.config.js base to:
```js
base: './'
```

### Console Error Debugging
1. Open https://wani-owais.github.io/ChatApp
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Check Network tab for failed requests
5. Look for 404 errors on CSS/JS files

### Common Issues:
- 404 on assets (fixed with correct base path)
- MIME type errors (fixed with proper server config)
- Blank page (usually React routing or asset loading issue)

### Current Configuration:
- Base path: /ChatApp/ (conditional)
- Homepage: https://wani-owais.github.io/ChatApp
- Build output: dist/
- Deployment: gh-pages package + GitHub Actions
